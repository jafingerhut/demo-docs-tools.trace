# demo-docs-tools.trace

I have programmed using Clojure as a hobby for several years, and knew
of tools.trace, but other than trying it out once or twice, never used
it much.  When using it for debugging an issue, I ran across some
confusing aspects of the included documentation, and also perhaps some
limitations of what the library can trace, vs. what it cannot, and I
wanted to make some notes about them for myself.
